![DASHBOARD](https://github.com/KumarBoste/Insurance_Risk_And_Claims_Analysis/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Dashboard/Insurance%20Risk%20%26%20Claims%20Analysis%20Dashboard%20SS.png)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze insurance risk and claim patterns using historical policy and claims data.
The dashboard aims to:
- Understand claim distribution across demographics, vehicles, and regions
- Identify high-risk segments contributing to higher claim amounts
- Support data-driven decision-making for underwriting, pricing, and risk management
- Improve future loss prevention strategies using actionable insights

## Problem Statement
Insurance companies face challenges such as:
- Rising claim costs
- Difficulty in identifying high-risk customers and vehicles
- Uneven claim distribution across age groups, regions, and policy types
- Limited visibility into how education, marital status, and driving behavior impact claims

This project addresses the following key questions:
- Which car usage type contributes most to claims?
- Which car makes and manufacturing years show higher risk?
- How do age groups and driving behavior influence claim amounts?
- Does education level and marital status impact claim severity?
- Which coverage zones are more prone to high claims?

## Data Visualization & Insights
### Key KPIs
- Total Policies: 37,542
- Total Claim Amount: $187.8M
- Average Claim Frequency: 0.5
- Average Claim Amount: $5,000

### Gender Distribution:
- Male: 18.7K
- Female: 18.8K

## Insights 

### 1. Claim Amount by Car Use
- Private vehicles: ~$150.4M
- Commercial vehicles: ~$37.4M

#### Insight:
Private vehicles contribute the majority of claims, indicating higher exposure due to frequent usage.

### 2. Claim Amount by Car Make
#### Top contributors:
- Ford – ~$16.6M
- Chevrolet – ~$14.8M
- Dodge, Toyota, GMC follow closely

#### Insight:
Popular mass-market brands show higher claim amounts due to larger vehicle populations on the road.

### 3. Claim Amount by Coverage Zone
#### Claim distribution is fairly balanced across:
- Urban
- Highly Urban
- Suburban
- Rural
- Highly Rural

#### Insight:
Urban and suburban areas show slightly higher claims due to traffic density and accident probability.

### 4. Claim Amount by Age Group
#### Highest claims observed in:
- 26–35
- 36–45
- 46–55 age groups

#### Insight:
Middle-aged drivers account for the largest claim amounts, likely due to higher vehicle usage and family responsibilities.

### 5. Claim Amount by Car Manufacturing Year
- Significant increase in claims from 2000 onwards
- Peak observed between 2010–2016

#### Insight:
Modern vehicles show higher claim amounts due to:
- Expensive spare parts
- Advanced technology repair costs

### 6. Claim Amount by Kids Driving
- Policyholders with 1–2 kids driving show noticeably higher claims

#### Insight:
Young or inexperienced drivers increase accident risk.

### 7. Claim Amount by Education
- Bachelors & Masters holders contribute the highest claim amounts

#### Insight:
Higher income groups may insure higher-value vehicles, resulting in larger claims.

### 8. Claim Amount by Education & Marital Status
- Married customers generate the highest total claims across all education levels
- Singles and divorced customers show moderate claim amounts

#### Insight:
Married individuals often have multiple vehicles and family drivers, increasing exposure.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that insurance risk is influenced by multiple interconnected factors such as:
- Vehicle usage type
- Driver age group
- Car make and year
- Driving behavior (kids driving)
- Socio-economic factors (education & marital status)
The dashboard provides a holistic view of claim behavior, helping insurers move from reactive claim handling to proactive risk management.
